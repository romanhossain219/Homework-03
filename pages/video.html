	<h3>Video tag has so many attributes. Such as (Autoplay, controls, loop, muted, preload, src, poster, width, height)</h3>
	<br>

	<P>width: It is better not to use height in video tag. Height takes automatically when we give width to the video. </P>
	<p>autoplay: Chromium browsers do not allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed. Add <u>muted</u> after <u>autoplay</u> to let your video file start playing automatically (but muted). </p>
